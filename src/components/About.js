                <p className="mb-5">Hello, I'm Rohit Kotian, a passionate and results-driven Software Engineer with a strong background in creating impactful digital experiences. I've had the privilege of working in the dynamic world of web development, both independently and collaboratively, to bring websites and applications to life.</p>
                <p className="mb-5">During my time at Accenture from October 2018 to May 2021, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, specializing in developing websites that are not only visually appealing but also mobile-friendly and responsive. Working directly with clients, I was responsible for maintaining and evolving their digital presence, ensuring the highest coding standards for efficiency and performance.</p>
                <p className="mb-5">In May 2021, I transitioned to my current role as a Software Engineer II here at Mastercard, where I've further expanded my expertise, primarily focusing on React.js for building additional application features and crafting scripts for APIs that gather critical data from active users. As a mentor to my colleagues, I take pride in guiding them towards efficient script development and actively participating in the code review process to enhance our team's collaborative output.</p>
                <p className="mb-5">My skills encompass React.js, SQL, TypeScript, Node.js, and JavaScript, allowing me to bring innovation and efficiency to every project I undertake. I'm always enthusiastic about learning and staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving web development landscape.</p>
